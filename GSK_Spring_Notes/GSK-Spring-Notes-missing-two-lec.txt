Lec 4 Gastrulation of mamallian

Fgf4 partial expression may prestage the fate of Epiblast cell before the other expression markers

Grb2 downstream of Fgf4. Fgf4 mutant epiblast cells can not transition to later stage.

Oct4 and Nanog Pluripotency TFs Nanog goes down when cell goes into later (prime) stage

NANOG and GATA6 mutual inhibit each other

EPI: FGF4 NANOG

PrE: FGF4 GATA6 (More receptor, more signaling, less negative feedback loop, GATA6 is activated)

In future: combine ESC,TSC and Xen cells to reconstitute embryo formation

FGF Inhibitor prevent PrE, promote EPI. generate a lot of naive ES cells

TS Cell: need FGF4 (promote proliferation) + TGF beta

MEF-CM makes TGF beta. Feeder medium (MEF)

XEN Cells: primitive endorderm.

single factor can convert ES cell to TSC and XEN cell

activin and Fgf4 will differentiate ESC to EpilCs.

ESC can not differenbtiate to germcell without going through EpiLCs

NANOG high in FGF4 mutant (bag of ES cells)

GASTRULATION

Important the survival of organism.

Formation of AP axis is important for the process of gastrulation. So it happens between Implantation and Gastrulation

T-box TF : a marker of primitive streak(posteria) Hesx1 anterior

Distal is later converted to anterior

Nodal and Wnt inhibitors express in anterior

nodal, wnt and BMP4 are important for primitive streak formation.
