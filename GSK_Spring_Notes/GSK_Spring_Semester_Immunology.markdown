# Overview of Immunology 
Adaptive immune systerm : generates and utilizes antigen specific receptor and involves rearrangements.

NK cell can detect the disappearance of MHC I molecule

Adaptive and innate do not directly kill bacterias: 

1. They either secrete cytokines to influence other cells (e.g. macrophages)

2. Or kill the cells infected by bacteria

Severe Combined Immunodeficiency: affects both B cell and T cell

# Innate Immunity

1. Drosophila does not have IFN. Innate immunity is different from mammals

2. T cell and NK cell secrete IFN-gamma when activated. It activates Macrophages, which
secretes IL12 to amplify NK and T cell. This creates a loop of cross amplification

3. IFN and IFN gamma are different: IFN and receptor are made by same cell, IFN gamma and receptor
are not made by the same cell.

4. Macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells are all come from hematopoietic lineage.

5. Different hematopoietic progenitors give rise to different cells in
   different locations and different time

6. Different waves in hematopoeitic progenitors differentiation

7. Lineage Tracing : CRE-ER stays in the cytoplasm, goes to nucleus when bound
   to its ligand (Tam).

8. Cell type specific epigenetic programs of marcrophage development

9. pDC produce and relaese Type I IFN; cDC involves in Antigen Presentation

10. neutrophils eat cells by secreting enzymes into space, while macrophages digest while eating.

11. There are no redundancy among monocytes, macrophages, DC and neutrophils.
