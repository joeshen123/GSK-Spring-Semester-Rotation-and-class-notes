# Overview of Immunology 
Adaptive immune systerm : generates and utilizes antigen specific receptor and involves rearrangements.

NK cell can detect the disappearance of MHC I molecule

Adaptive and innate do not directly kill bacterias: 

1. They either secrete cytokines to influence other cells (e.g. macrophages)

2. Or kill the cells infected by bacteria

Severe Combined Immunodeficiency: affects both B cell and T cell

# Innate Immunity

1. Drosophila does not have IFN. Innate immunity is different from mammals

2. T cell and NK cell secrete IFN-gamma when activated. It activates Macrophages, which
secretes IL12 to amplify NK and T cell. This creates a loop of cross amplification

3. IFN and IFN gamma are different: IFN and receptor are made by same cell, IFN gamma and receptor
are not made by the same cell.

4. Macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells are all come from hematopoietic lineage.

5. Different hematopoietic progenitors give rise to different cells in
   different locations and different time

6. Different waves in hematopoeitic progenitors differentiation

7. Lineage Tracing : CRE-ER stays in the cytoplasm, goes to nucleus when bound
   to its ligand (Tam).

8. Cell type specific epigenetic programs of marcrophage development

9. pDC produce and relaese Type I IFN; cDC involves in Antigen Presentation

10. neutrophils eat cells by secreting enzymes into space, while macrophages digest while eating.

11. There are no redundancy among monocytes, macrophages, DC and neutrophils. 

# NK Cell Biology

## Overview

1. NK Cell develops do not need thymus

2. NK Cell does not use RAG to rearrange TCR like T cells.

3. 70% of NK Cells reside in the interface of maternal-fetal in decidual (Still unknown the 
reason)

4. natural killing : Cell-mediated cytotoxicity (secrete Perforin and Granzymes)
   Produce IFN-gamma and other cytokine

5. NK Cells are also activated by cytokines:
   
   - IL-2 and IL-15 recognized by Common Gamma Chain Receptor, required for proliferation 

   - IL-12 and IL-18 activate NK Cell IFN-gamma secretion

6. NK Cells are important for defense of Viral infections

7. NK cell therapy does not have autoimmune side-effects as T cell therapy

8. Missing Self Hypothesis: NK cells recognize cells loss MHC Class I. (Class I is expressing
   in all cells, loss of it means missing self)

9. NK cell is regulated by both + and - signals:
   - MHC Class I is - signals
   - virus-infected cells also express stress ligands (kill me flags) + signals

## NK Cell Development

1. E4BP4 is important for NK Cell development

2. During the development, NK cell needs to be inhibited (via inhibitors), then NK Cells can advance into peripheral and function --- NK Cell Education

3. Unlike T cell education, unlicensed NK cells do not die and make into peripheral.

## NK Cell in virus infection

1. NKG2D ligands (stress ligands, kill me flags)

2. NK cell proliferation is similar to clonal proliferation of T cells.

## NK cell in Tumor immune surveillance

1. NKG2D ligands are induced in virus-infected cells and tumor cells and by DNA damage.

2. Structurally, NKG2D ligands are similar to MHC Class I.

3. Tumors through Macrophages shedding NKG2D ligands, hiding from NK cell.

## Harnessing NK cell for cancer therapy

1. Transplant NK cell iKIR-HLA mismatch, they can not recognize MHC Class I, therefore they can not be inhibited. 
   but healthy cell does not have stress ligands, so healthy cell can not activate NK Cell.

## Additional

- Emerging concept that NK cells mediate several adaptive immunity features even though they do not rearrange receptors.
