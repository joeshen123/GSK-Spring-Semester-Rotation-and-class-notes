* -[[6A]]: Purify tumors based on FACs (PECAM1 + and tdTomato +), TUMOR CELL, TUMOR VASCULATURE AND TOM- STROMA


* -[[6b]]: Only TOM+PECAM1- have sphere initiating capacity


* -[[6c-e]]: Only T+/P- express SHH Pathway genes and myogenic genes


* [[Summary First Part]]: Able to seperate tumor cells (T+/P-) and tumor vascular cells (T+/p+) in tumors using PECAM and tomato labeling (FACS sorting)


* -[[Hypothesis Second Part]]: Examination of T+/P- tumor cell gene expression.


* -[[S6G]]: Compare to the double negative, T+/P- Tumors have enrichment in TFs in development.


* -[[6F]]: Muscle Cell differentiation genes are enriched


* -[[6G]]: head and neck muscle specification genes upstream of Mrf are highly expressed in T+/P- cells compared to other cell types


* -[[6H-I]]: in E15.5, TbX1 is colocalized with ap2-Cre-labeled cell, but not MyoD-1. Suggesting Tbx1 precedds MyoD-1 expression. But there are some redundancy.


* -[[Conclusion]]: Tumor cells express myogenic specification factors important for head and muscle development.
